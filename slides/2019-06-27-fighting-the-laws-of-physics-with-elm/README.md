# Fighting the Laws of Physics with Elm

Slides from [elm Europe 2019](https://2019.elmeurope.org/).

There is no doubt that the Elm architecture and Virtual DOM make Elm enjoyable for building web apps. When it comes to the domain of real-time graphics, it still remains underdeveloped. Even though this opens up a whole new range of opportunities, is Elm ready for such experiments?

Having accepted a challenge of building a dice roller game, I ended up rolling my own physics engine. With no prior experience in computational physics, I studied existing implementations. Through a try and error, I programmed the necessary bits in pure Elm.

From this talk you will learn how it was possible because of existing tooling. You will see how types and immutability make complex algorithms easier to comprehend. And of course, you will share my excitement of watching the demos on the big screen!
